# AI-Machine-Learning
A basic Linear Regression model in Machine Learning.
This repository demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression, one of the most fundamental algorithms in Machine Learning. Linear Regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). The project includes:

Data preprocessing
Model training
Evaluation metrics
Visualization of results

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies: git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-regression-ml.git cd linear-regression-ml pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage

Run the training script: python src/model.py

Or explore the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook notebooks/linear_regression.ipynb

📊 Example Output

Scatter plot of data points with regression line
Evaluation metrics such as:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R² Score
🧪 Technologies Used

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Scikit-learn
📈 Results

The model successfully fits a regression line to the dataset, showing how well linear regression can capture trends in data. Example plots and metrics are stored in the results/ folder.
